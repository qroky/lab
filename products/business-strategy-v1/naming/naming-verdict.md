# Naming Due Diligence — Verdict

| Field | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Product | Naming verdict, RPF Business Strategy v1 |
| Produced by | ATOM-008 (executor role: venture-strategist) |
| Maturity | `reviewed` (target) — human sign-off at G1 |
| Date | 2026-07-05 |
| Method | The 7-point hard-DoD checklist of the parent INPUT §3.3, applied in order of cheapness |

**Headline: the front-runner falls at the cheapest check.** "Atomaro" is a live commercial software product of Rostelecom (Russian national telecom, ~PAO scale) — a design-system platform with paid tiers, listed in the Russian domestic-software registry. The clean-field evidence in the input is superseded by this finding. The reserve, "Qroky", survives every check run today but two register-level probes remain open.

## Candidate 1 — Atomaro (front-runner at intake)

| # | Checklist point | Evidence | Result |
| :- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Live-company search in category | **FAIL.** "Атомаро/Atomaro" is Rostelecom's commercial design-system platform: ready UI kits (Figma/React), tiers Pro (free) / Pro+ (50 000 ₽/yr) / Enterprise; developed by ООО «Ростелеком Информационные Технологии»; in the RU domestic-software registry; sold via rtk-market.ru and resellers (source: atomaro.design/business, rtkit.ru/products/dizain-sistema-atomaro, rtk-market.ru/product/atomaro, figma.com community file "Atomaro Pro Design System" — all live 2026-07-05) | kill-grade collision |
| 2 | GitHub namespace | Org `atomaro-hq` owned by us (source: parent INPUT §3.3, 2026-07-05) — moot given point 1 | pass (moot) |
| 3 | Trademark screen EUIPO/USPTO/WIPO + phonetic neighbors | No Atomaro registration surfaced via web search in EUIPO/USPTO-indexed sources; formal register queries **not performed** (registers not directly queryable from this run — not verifiable here). Rostelecom registered Atomaro as a solution in 2023 (source: tadviser.com Rostelecom strategy article, fetched 2026-07-05); a RU trademark must be **assumed**. Phonetic neighbor Atomico (London VC): moderate distance (a-to-MA-ro vs a-TO-mi-co) but same startup ecosystem — moot given point 1 | fail by assumption |
| 4 | Domain field state | atomaro.dev/.app owned by us; atomaro.com squatted, dormant holder, expires 2026-11-10, backorder planned (source: parent INPUT §3.3, 2026-07-05). **Backorder now inadvisable** — money into a name a Rostelecom product owns in the wild | pass mechanically, moot |
| 5 | 5-second comprehension (non-technical founder) | "Atom" hook reads instantly; but first page of RU-language search results is Rostelecom's product (source: web search 2026-07-05) — a Moldovan/RU-speaking founder googling the name lands on Rostelecom | fail in practice |
| 6 | Pronounceability en/ro/ru/fr | Clean in all four (source: executor judgment, ATOM-008, 2026-07-05) — moot | pass (moot) |
| 7 | sed-replaceability | Repo uses only the placeholder "RPF"; no early lock-in occurred — the checklist discipline paid for itself (source: repo grep, 2026-07-05) | pass |

**Atomaro verdict: KILL.** Identical name, same broad category (software development tooling), massive incumbent, dominant in the RU-language search space that includes our home market. Registering or building brand equity here invites confusion and a hopeless SEO/trademark position.

## Candidate 2 — Qroky (reserve at intake)

| # | Checklist point | Evidence | Result |
| :- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Live-company search in category | No company, product, or trademark surfaced for "Qroky" in web search; nearest hits are unrelated (ROKKY gaming trademark, Qore Performance) (source: web search 2026-07-05) | pass |
| 2 | GitHub namespace | **CLOSED by acquisition:** org `github.com/qroky` created and owned by the human (source: human confirmation + owner-view screenshot, 2026-07-05; evidence update at this touch, `decisions/INFO-002`) | pass — secured |
| 3 | Trademark screen EUIPO/USPTO/WIPO + phonetic neighbors | **CLOSED:** formal screen run by the human via TMview (~100 registers incl. EUIPO/WIPO/USPTO/AGEPI), 2026-07-05. Exact `qroky`: 0 rows anywhere. Near-string `qrok`: 11 rows, none live in classes 9/42 — QROK GmbH (Ukraine, cl. 35/9/42, the F1 neighbor) Ended; qroko/QROKEE/Qroktag (France) Expired; live hits only in foreign classes/markets (cl. 41/5/44/31/10) (source: `decisions/INFO-003`, human-run TMview screenshots). Caveat: TMview has no legal effect — formal FTO opinion optional at future filing | **pass — probe closed** |
| 4 | Domain field state | **CLOSED by acquisition:** qroky.com registered by the human 2026-06-27 (whois: created 2026-06-27, registrar Instra, parked pending use; source: whois check + human confirmation, 2026-07-05, `decisions/INFO-002`). The intake evidence "fully available" (§3.3) was already stale at verdict time — the human had secured it before the atom ran | pass — secured |
| 5 | 5-second comprehension | Zero semantics — communicates nothing by itself; neutral vessel, no wrong meaning in target languages (source: executor judgment, ATOM-008, 2026-07-05) | neutral |
| 6 | Pronounceability en/ro/ru/fr | Pronounceable in all four ("KRO-kee"); minor en ambiguity Q-without-u, resolved on first hearing (source: executor judgment, ATOM-008, 2026-07-05) | pass |
| 7 | sed-replaceability | Same repo state as above — one `sed` swap when adopted (source: repo grep, 2026-07-05) | pass |

**Qroky verdict: GO — cleared for public use** (vocabulary per ATOM-008-VERIFY F2, absorbed: a **go** within {go, hold, kill}; its condition was lifted when the last probe closed). History: GitHub org + qroky.com secured by the human (`decisions/INFO-002`); formal register screen clean (`decisions/INFO-003`, 2026-07-05). All conditions closed — the "RPF"→Qroky swap awaits only the human's rebrand-timing decision.

## Dead candidate — Atomos (record for NOT-DOING)
Killed at intake: live London company "Atomos AI" + video-hardware trademark holder (source: parent INPUT §3.3, 2026-07-05). Confirms the same lesson as Atomaro: the atom-semantic field is crowded.

## Atomico confusion flag (required assessment)
Atomico is a top-tier London VC active in European startup circles our channels touch. For **Atomaro** the confusion risk compounded the Rostelecom kill. For **Qroky** there is no phonetic or visual proximity — no confusion risk (source: executor judgment, ATOM-008, 2026-07-05).

## Verdict
| Candidate | Verdict |
| :---- | :---- |
| Atomaro | **kill** — checklist point 1 hard fail (Rostelecom collision) |
| Qroky | **go — cleared for public use** (all probes closed 2026-07-05: org + domain by acquisition, INFO-002; formal registers clean, INFO-003) |
| Atomos | kill (intake, confirmed) |

**Recommendation (exactly one):** promote **Qroky** to front-runner; cancel the atomaro.com backorder; keep the "RPF" placeholder in all artifacts until the remaining probe closes. *(Updated 2026-07-05, `decisions/INFO-002`: qroky.com and the GitHub org were already secured by the human — the "register now" instruction is moot; only the formal EUIPO/USPTO/WIPO screen stands between Qroky and public use.)* Lesson fed to NOT-DOING: atom-semantic names — crowded field, two kills; revisit only with a full point-1-first screen.
