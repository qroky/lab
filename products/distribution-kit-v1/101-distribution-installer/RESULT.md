# RESULT — ATOM-101

## Summary

Delivered the complete, tested Distribution Kit v1 installer under
`distribution/`: `install.sh` (753 lines) — a single bash entry point that
interviews a stranger at exactly the seven declared points (language,
working folder, Claude Code check, subscription check, Telegram opt-in with
a hand-held BotFather walkthrough and live `getMe` token validation,
daily-support-sharing opt-in with show-what-leaves-before-asking, and
benefit-framed heartbeat/morning-digest consent), vendors the framework
with provenance, and ends with the exact handoff to `qroky start`. Every
step is a self-contained `check -> do` pair backed by a hand-written flat
JSON state file (`install-state.json`, no `jq` dependency — POSIX+curl+git
only per H1) that makes reruns resume exactly where they stopped and turns
a healthy rerun into a free, silent health check. A failure ladder (2 auto
-retries, then a concrete named human action) covers every step; the
Telegram bot token is the one secret in scope and is written only to a
mode-600 file, never to state/log/telemetry/git. A self-update channel
(`--check-update` / `--show-update-details` / `--apply-update`) tracks
release tags only, shows local-edit conflicts before ever touching them,
and records every applied update as a plain-language decision file inside
the user's own workspace.

`distribution/dry-run.sh` (543 lines) is the sandbox harness: it shadows
`claude`, `curl` (Telegram's `getMe` only), and `launchctl` on `PATH`,
stands up a real, local, tagged git repository as the framework origin, and
runs `install.sh` completely unmodified against those fakes. It exercises
9 scenarios end to end — full clean run, kill-mid-install, healthy rerun,
broken dependency, double-run idempotency diff, secrets negative grep,
self-update (tag N -> N+1 with a planted local-edit conflict), and both
branches of the heartbeat consent question — and writes a timed, real
transcript of each to this atom's `workspace/` folder. **Current state: 9/9
PASS.** Building the harness surfaced and fixed five real bugs (see
Decisions/Deviations below and `workspace/run.log`), including one that, if
shipped, would have silently reused one stale workspace across independent
installer runs.

## DoD Self-Check (parent ATOM-100 H1-H11, S1-S3)

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| H1 — single entry point, bash, POSIX+curl+git only, checks + human words on missing deps | met | `distribution/install.sh` `main_interview()` checks `git`/`curl` before anything else with a named fix per OS; `step_claude_code` does the same for `claude`. No other runtime dependency anywhere in the file (`grep -E 'jq\|python\|node'` over install.sh: zero hits). |
| H2 — interview covers exactly the 7 declared points, in chosen language, zero questions outside | met | `scenario-1-full-clean-run.txt`, "Question inventory check" section: every interactive `read_answer` call site inside the 7 `step_*` functions is tagged `# IV-POINT:<n>:<name>`; 6/6 call sites tagged (points 3 "Claude Code" and 4 "subscription" are automatic checks with no `read`, per the parent's own Method Hints — "a CHECK... not a purchase flow"); distinct points referenced: 1,2,5,5,6,7 — all within the closed list of 7. |
| H3 — self-managing idempotency: check->do steps, rerun resumes without re-asking, healthy rerun = free no-op | met | `scenario-3-healthy-rerun.txt`: file-tree hash diff and state-field diff (excluding the commit timestamp) both empty after a rerun on Scenario-1's finished workspace; 7 "already set up" health-check lines printed, zero new prompts. `scenario-5-idempotency-diff.txt`: two full runs with identical answers produce an identical file listing and identical structural state. |
| H4 — secrets perimeter: token file mode 600, never in state/log/telemetry/git | met (r2: evidence corrected per verify F4) | `scenario-6-secrets-negative-grep.txt` (round-2 rerun): zero grep hits for the raw token across `install-state.json`, `install.log`, `telemetry/`, and full git history of both the workspace repo and the vendored `framework/` repo; token file mode confirmed `600`. Round-2 change: install.sh now actually WRITES the masked confirmation (`telegram TOKEN-STORED masked=****<last4> file_mode=600`) to `install.log` — the round-1 claim that it did was false (the masked line went to stdout only, verify F4) — and the harness check for that line is now a hard requirement, not informational. |
| H5 — finale prints, in chosen language, how to open Claude Code + "qroky start" | met | `scenario-1-full-clean-run.txt` tail: "Type: claude" / "Say: qroky start"; separately spot-checked in Russian (ad hoc, see run.log) — same phrase renders literally regardless of interview language, per parent H5's "exact words". |
| H6 — sandbox harness proves clean path <=15min zero out-of-interview questions PLUS 3 scenarios (kill-mid, healthy rerun, broken dependency) | met (r2: H6a evidence rebuilt per verify F1) | `scenario-1`: exit 0 in 0-1s (budget 900s). `scenario-2-kill-mid-install.txt` (round-2 rerun — the round-1 transcript was vacuous: the opt-out answer feed exited before the delay hook, so no kill ever landed, verify F1): RUN A now opts INTO Telegram so the delay hook is guaranteed mid-flight; transcript shows `(process <pid> SIGKILLed mid-step, as intended)`, the post-kill state file shows `step_workdir: done` + `step_telegram: pending` (true mid-flight proof), and the scenario HARD-FAILS if the kill misses or the state shows no pending step; RUN B resumes without re-asking language/workdir and completes all-done. `scenario-3`: see H3. `scenario-4-broken-dependency.txt`: unreachable framework source -> 2 auto-retries -> concrete human instruction under the correct step header, no raw git output on screen (r2, verify F7), prior steps' `done` state preserved. |
| H7 — blind verify: accept | pending (round 1: RETURN; this is the round-2 resubmission) | Round 1 returned with 2 blocking + 6 minor findings — all 8 fixed this round (see "Round 2" section below). Out of this atom's own authority to self-close; no verifier conversation happened in either round, per instructions. |
| H8 — install-state.json present + consistent after every scenario | met | Present and internally consistent (steps/answers reflect exactly what happened) in every one of the 9 scenario transcripts; flat single-level JSON, `version`/`generated_at`/7×`answer_*`/7×`step_*`/3×`framework_*` fields, machine-parseable for Tree B (ATOM-110) without a JSON library dependency in the reader either, if it chooses the same grep approach. |
| H9 — failure ladder: self-diagnosis -> known-remedy auto-attempt -> concrete human action; max 2 auto-attempts, 3rd always human | met | `scenario-4-broken-dependency.txt`: exactly 2 "trying again automatically" lines, then the concrete instruction ("Check the internet connection, then run this installer again..."), exit 1. Ladder implemented once (`run_with_ladder`), shared by every step that has a real automatic remedy (network retry); steps with no automatic remedy (Claude Code not installed) skip straight to the human action — documented design choice, not a silent gap (see Decisions). |
| H10 — heartbeat consent: benefit-framed question + 1 honest line, да->installed+enabled, нет->installed disabled + 1-command enable instruction, both branches exercised, disabled branch leaves no running agent | met | `scenario-8-heartbeat-both-branches.txt`: "yes" branch — plist generated AND the fake `launchctl` log shows a `bootstrap` call for it; "no" branch — plist generated (file exists) but the fake `launchctl` log shows **zero** bootstrap calls during that run, and the one-command enable instruction (`--enable-heartbeat`) is printed. This scenario was added specifically because the parent's own check text names "both branches exercised in the H6 harness" — see Decisions #7. |
| H11 — self-update: release tags only (never main), digest (3-line changelog + да/позже/подробнее), apply only on explicit да, decisions/ record in USER's workspace, conflicts shown before apply, shared state/trace | met (r2: F2 fixed, F3/F5 evidence rebuilt) | `scenario-7-self-update.txt` (round-2 rerun): `--check-update` fetches tags only (`git tag -l 'v*'`, never checks out `main`/a branch) and the digest now carries ALL THREE changelog body lines verbatim — the round-1 extraction wasted its 3-line budget on the tag subject + blank separator, dropping two of them (verify F2; fixed via `%(contents:body)` + blank-line strip, and the scenario now asserts each of the three lines individually). The "нет" cancel is now exercised FIRST, while the v1.0.0→v1.1.0 update is genuinely pending (round 1 ran it after the apply, when nothing was pending — vacuous, verify F5): transcript shows the confirm prompt reached, the cancel message, and `framework_tag` still `v1.0.0` after it. Then a local edit planted in `framework/README.md` — `--apply-update` SHOWS the porcelain diff (`M README.md` ONLY: the installer's own `PROVENANCE.md` is excluded via `.git/info/exclude` + a porcelain filter, so untouched installs no longer see a false "local changes" alarm, verify F3; asserted zero PROVENANCE lines) — and "да" stashes/checks out/re-applies and writes `decisions/UPDATE-<date>-v1.1.0.md`; `framework_tag` advances to `v1.1.0`. |
| S1 — every user-facing line: no method jargon, failures loud+specific with a human next step | self-reviewed, final judge Verify | `grep -inE 'atom\|DoD\|FEV\|verify\|gate'` across all of `lang/*.sh` and `README.*.md`, filtered to exclude `#`-comment lines: zero hits inside any actual user-facing string (the only hits are in bash header comments, which are never shown to a founder and themselves state the no-jargon rule). Every `fail_to_human`/`L_CLAUDE_MISSING`/etc. message names a concrete next action, never a bare error code. |
| S2 — BotFather walkthrough is genuinely hand-holding | self-reviewed, final judge Verify + CEO dry run (G2) | `L_TELEGRAM_WALKTHROUGH` (all 3 languages): 7 numbered steps naming the exact app, the exact search term ("BotFather"), the exact command to send (`/newbot`), and what the token looks like, ending in a live `getMe` check with a plain-language retry hint ("a space or line break got copied along... copy again, carefully" / "it was already reset — open BotFather, send /token"). Not measured against an actual never-heard-of-bots human — that measurement is explicitly G2 (CEO dry run, HUMAN-TASK), outside this atom's authority. |
| S3 — release criterion: clean machine, <=15min, zero questions outside interview | self-reviewed, final judge CEO dry run (G2) | Scenario 1: 0-1s in a stubbed sandbox (network-free by construction — a real founder's real download time for Claude Code/git/the framework clone is the variable component, same documented caveat 071's RESULT.md carried forward). Question count: see H2. G2 itself — a real clean machine, a real human, real network — is explicitly out of this atom's authority (HUMAN-TASK, parent DoD). |

## Decisions Made by Executor (O9.1)

1. **Workspace layout** — `QROKY_WORKSPACE_DIR` default `./qroky` (same name/default as 071's `bootstrap.sh`, for continuity); `install-state.json`, `install.log`, `decisions/` sit at the TOP of that folder (not nested under a second `qroky/`), alongside `framework/` (vendored) and `.qroky/telegram.token` (the one secret, mode 600). Documented in every README's "Don't touch my instance" section.
2. **State file format** — hand-written flat single-level JSON (globally-unique `step_*`/`answer_*` keys, grep-extractable with no `jq`/YAML-library dependency, matching H1's dependency constraint and the same reasoning `072/telemetry/push.sh` already uses for `status.yaml`). Whole file rewritten fresh from the process's own shell variables on every commit — no associative arrays, so it stays bash-3.2-compatible (the same stock-macOS-bash constraint `071/RESULT.md` flagged).
3. **Real interactive prompts** — unlike 071's zero-question `bootstrap.sh`, this atom's mandate IS an interview, so `install.sh` uses real `read`. Every interactive call site is tagged `# IV-POINT:<n>:<name>` specifically so the harness can machine-check "question inventory equals the closed list" (H2) rather than relying on a hand count.
4. **Test-stub strategy** — PATH-shadowing (fake `claude`/`curl`/`launchctl`, a real local tagged git repo standing in for the framework remote) is the primary mechanism, following 071's already-reviewed pattern; `install.sh` needs zero test-mode branches for those three. Exactly ONE explicit `QROKY_TEST_STUBS=1` in-script hook exists (the soft subscription/login heuristic), matching the INPUT's own suggested example; every other path is production-identical between sandbox and reality.
5. **Self-update lives inside install.sh as flags**, not a separately-deliverable daemon script (the INPUT's own deliverable list names no such file) — `install.sh` generates the end user's heartbeat runner + launchd plist at Step 7, with THIS machine's own paths substituted, and that generated runner calls `install.sh --check-update` daily. H1's "single entry point" stays literally true.
6. **Claude Code step has no auto-retry ladder** — "software is not installed" has no automatic remedy among the three named in H9 (network retry / lock wait / permission hint), so that step goes straight to the human instruction rather than performing 2 pointless retries first. Framework vendoring (the step with a real network dependency) carries the full ladder instead — exercised in Scenario 4.
7. **Added Scenario 8 (heartbeat both branches) mid-build** — the parent's H10 check text explicitly requires "both branches exercised in the H6 harness", which the original 7-scenario plan (drawn from the INPUT's bullet list, which does not separately name this) did not cover. Added it once noticed, rather than treating H10's check clause as satisfied by inference from Scenario 1 alone.
8. **`git submodule` idempotency check uses `-e`, not `-d`, for `framework/.git`** — a submodule's `.git` is a FILE (gitlink), not a directory; caught before this reached the harness (would have silently re-run the vendor step on every single invocation, defeating H3's health-check promise for that step specifically).

## Deviations & Known Limitations (V3 — none silent)

- **H7 is not self-closable** — this RESULT.md is the blind-verify package; no verifier conversation occurred, per the executor's own instructions. Listed as "pending" above, not "met", to keep the table honest.
- **Telemetry step (interview point 6) records consent only** — it does not vendor `072-telemetry-showcase/telemetry/push.sh` into the user's workspace. That script already exists as a separate, already-reviewed product; this atom's closed deliverable list (INPUT section 2) names `install.sh` + `lang/` + `README.*` + `dry-run.sh`, not a copy of 072's telemetry mechanism. The consent flag (`answer_telemetry_optin`) and the same `telemetry/OFF`-file convention 071/072 already use are wired for real, ready for a future atom to point the real push script at. Round-2 change (verify F6): the consent screen and all three READMEs now inline the VERBATIM 5-item whitelist (what each file contributes, structural fields only) and state plainly that no sending mechanism is installed today — so a "yes" is informed by the list itself, not by a pointer to a repo path a kit user does not have; the founder is promised sight of the sending script line-by-line before it is ever added.
- **Subscription check (interview point 4) is a heuristic, not a certainty** — it looks for one of three plausible Claude Code credential file locations (`~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/credentials`, `~/.config/claude`) and prints a soft, non-blocking NOTICE if none is found. The real, authoritative check would be an actual Claude Code API call, which the Method Hints explicitly say NOT to build ("a CHECK... not a purchase flow"). Documented in `install.sh`'s own header comment and here.
- **S2/S3's true judges (a genuinely bot-naive human; a real clean machine on a real network) are outside this atom's authority** — both are explicitly the parent's G2 (CEO dry run, HUMAN-TASK). This atom's own evidence is the closest machine-checkable proxy (structured walkthrough content; a network-free timed run), not a substitute for the human judgment the parent DoD itself defers.
- **Framework vendoring pins to the latest matching tag, or HEAD if none exists** — same "no release tags published yet" caveat 071/RESULT.md carried forward; the dry-run harness manufactures its own tags (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) specifically to exercise the self-update path, since the real `qroky/framework` repository has none yet at the time of this build.
- **macOS-centric heartbeat mechanics** — `launchctl`/`LaunchAgents` are macOS-only; `install.sh` detects a missing `launchctl` and falls back to a NOTICE + manual run instruction (same shape as 071's `crontab` fallback), but this fallback path itself was not exercised as an isolated scenario in this harness (only the macOS `launchctl`-present path was, via the fake). Logged, not silent.
- **Bug-fix trail** — five real bugs were found and fixed while building this atom's OWN harness (a bash pipeline env-var scoping bug that produced a real stray directory on this machine before being caught and cleaned up; two `set -u`/unbound-variable bugs in the self-update flag commands; an off-by-one in the failure ladder's retry count; a `grep -r` single-file formatting bug; and a heredoc `%s` non-substitution bug in the update digest). Full narrative in `workspace/run.log`. None of these reached a committed transcript uncorrected — the second and third full harness runs are what is filed here.

## Round 2 — fix round after blind-verify RETURN (round 1)

Verdict: `../101-distribution-installer-verify/VERDICT.md` — RETURN, 2
blocking (F1, F2) + 6 minor (F3–F8). All 8 accepted as valid and fixed.
The verifier's own probes confirmed the underlying machinery (resume,
consent gates, secrets perimeter, idempotency) was sound; the defects were
in my committed evidence (two vacuous scenario proofs) and in claims my
own transcripts refuted — exactly the V3-honesty class this section owns.

| Finding | Fix | New evidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| F1 (blocking, H6a) — kill scenario never killed: opt-out feed exited before the delay hook | Scenario 2's RUN A now opts INTO Telegram (`y` + GOODTOKEN456), reaching the `QROKY_TEST_DELAY_STEP=telegram` window (after token storage, before the step's commit); delay 15s, SIGKILL at t+4s; the scenario HARD-FAILS if the kill misses a live process, if post-kill state lacks `step_workdir: done` + `step_telegram` not-done, or if the rerun re-asks the language question | `scenario-2-kill-mid-install.txt`: "(process NNNNN SIGKILLed mid-step, as intended)"; post-kill state `step_telegram: "pending"`; RUN B all-done, exit 0, language not re-asked |
| F2 (blocking, H11) — digest dropped 2 of 3 changelog lines (head -3 spent on subject + blank) | Extraction switched to `git tag -l --format='%(contents:body)'` + blank-line strip + `head -3`; the decisions record and `--show-update-details` switched to `%(contents)` formats; Scenario 7 asserts each of the three body lines verbatim | `scenario-7-self-update.txt` lines 6–13: all three lines ("fixes…", "improves…", "adds…") in the digest |
| F3 (minor) — false "local changes" alarm from untracked PROVENANCE.md | PROVENANCE.md written to the framework checkout's `.git/info/exclude` at vendor time + belt-and-braces `grep -v` on the porcelain output in `cmd_apply_update` | Scenario 7 asserts zero "PROVENANCE" lines in both conflict displays; conflict shows `M README.md` only |
| F4 (minor, V3) — RESULT claimed a masked log line that did not exist | Took the "actually log it" branch: install.sh writes `telegram TOKEN-STORED masked=****<last4> file_mode=600` to install.log; harness check flipped to REQUIRED; H4 row rewritten | `scenario-6…txt`: "masked-token confirmation line present in install.log (REQUIRED): yes"; raw-token greps still all 0 |
| F5 (minor, V3) — "нет" cancel ran after the apply, never reached the prompt | Scenario 7 reordered: cancel runs FIRST, against the genuinely pending update; asserts prompt reached + cancel message + `framework_tag` still v1.0.0 | `scenario-7…txt`: "cancel check: confirm prompt reached: yes; cancelled message shown: yes; framework_tag still v1.0.0: yes" — before the apply block |
| F6 (minor, H2) — consent screen promised "EXACTLY what leaves" but gave a category summary + dangling pointer | Verbatim 5-item whitelist inlined in the consent screen (all 3 languages) and in all 3 READMEs; dangling `products/pilot-prerequisites-v1/…` path removed; "no sending mechanism installed today" stated plainly | `lang/{en,ro,ru}.sh` `L_TELEMETRY_ASK_OPTIN`; `README.*.md` "What leaves this computer"; scenario-1 transcript shows the full list before the question |
| F7 (minor, S1/H9) — framework failure mislabeled under the Claude header, raw git spew | Step order swapped (Claude check first, visibly succeeding on its own line); vendoring announced under its own plain line (`L_FRAMEWORK_VENDORING`, 3 languages); all git stderr routed to install.log; failure text names the rulebook + points at the log | `scenario-4…txt`: Claude found on its own line; SETUP STOPPED block names the rulebook, zero `fatal:`/`error:` lines on screen, git details confirmed present in install.log (all asserted) |
| F8 (minor, H9) — launchctl bootstrap failure aborted outside the ladder | `_heartbeat_enable_attempt` now runs through `run_with_ladder` (2 auto-retries); final failure degrades to `L_HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULE_FAILED` (installed-but-off + the one-command enable instruction, 3 languages) instead of a raw `set -e` abort; same treatment in `cmd_enable_heartbeat`; launchctl stderr to install.log | install.sh `_heartbeat_enable_attempt`/`step_heartbeat`; failure path not scenario-exercised (fake launchctl succeeds) — noted as a remaining limitation below |

Round-2 harness iteration, honestly: the first rerun after the fixes was
8/9 — my own new scenario-4 mis-attribution heuristic false-positived on
the legitimate "downloading the rulebook" line that now follows the Claude
header by design; corrected the heuristic to test what F7 actually
requires (Claude visibly succeeded + failure block never mentions Claude),
second rerun 9/9 PASS. All transcripts in `workspace/` are from the final
passing run. Remaining known limitation added by F8's fix: the
bootstrap-failure degradation path itself is exercised by no scenario (the
fake launchctl always succeeds) — the code path exists and is ladder-
wrapped, but its evidence is code review, not a transcript.

## Handoff

Verification mode: blind (ATOM-101-VERIFY, tier L) per INPUT frontmatter —
receives this RESULT.md plus the full `distribution/**` tree and this
atom's `workspace/` transcripts; no verifier conversation occurs. Tree B
(ATOM-110) is the next consumer in line: it reads `install-state.json`'s
`answer_telegram_token_stored` flag and the `.qroky/telegram.token` file
path as its instance ground state, per the parent's stated dependency.

## v0.1.1 amendment (ATOM-102 — mandated by INFO-030 п.3 + п.4)

The interview's closed list was extended BY ITS OWNER (CEO directive
INFO-030, 10.07.2026) to EIGHT points; a disclaimer layer was mandated for
the kit texts. Same executor, same role, warm context. Input:
`../102-kit-amendment/INPUT.md`. New transcripts:
`../102-kit-amendment/workspace/` (the round-2 transcripts in this atom's
own `workspace/` are untouched evidence of v0.1.0).

### What changed

1. **Interview point 8 — backup opt-in** (`# IV-POINT:8:backup_optin`,
   default/recommendation = yes, runs after the heartbeat point so the
   first push captures the complete installed workspace). Benefit-framed
   question in all three locales with one honest line: the copy goes to
   the USER'S OWN private GitHub account, nobody else's. The "yes" path is
   the BotFather pattern applied to `gh`: presence check (plain install
   hint if missing → continue without backup), `gh auth login --web`
   preceded by a 6-step numbered human walkthrough (account creation
   covered — "only an email address is needed"), then a ladder-wrapped
   (≤2 auto-retries) add/commit/`gh repo create qroky-backup --private
   --source --push`. Every failure (no gh, auth failed, push failed)
   degrades in plain language WITH the enable-later command and the
   install continues to the finale — the backup can never kill a setup.
   Commit identity falls back to a neutral "Qroky backup <qroky-backup@local>"
   `-c` override ONLY when the machine has no git identity. Opt-out is
   recorded in `install-state.json` (`answer_backup_optin: no`, step done —
   never re-asked, no nagging); `bash install.sh --enable-backup` is the
   documented enable-later path (mirrors `--enable-heartbeat`).
2. **Secrets never enter the backup (H4 extension)** — opt-in writes a
   marker-guarded (check→do, idempotent) exclusion block into the
   workspace `.gitignore`: `.qroky/telegram.token`, `*.token`, `.env`/
   `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`, and
   `install.log` (it carries the masked-token audit line; excluding logs
   wholesale is stricter than strictly needed and cheaper to reason
   about). Restore = one command, documented in all three READMEs:
   `gh repo clone qroky-backup`, then one `install.sh` run inside the
   clone to re-attach the pinned rulebook submodule.
3. **Disclaimer layer (INFO-030 п.4)** — the finale screen now ends with a
   properly localized responsibility note (drafts and analysis only;
   legal/financial/medical decisions and signatures are always human; not
   professional advice) via a new `L_DISCLAIMER` in all three locales, and
   the same note closes all three READMEs. READMEs also gained the
   question-8 entry with the FAQ line («бэкап уходит в ВАШ аккаунт» /
   "the backup goes to YOUR account" / „copia de siguranță merge în contul
   TĂU"), the "Backup and restore" section, and "seven questions" → eight
   throughout.
4. **Harness (now 10 scenarios)** — new Scenario 9, opt-in + opt-out
   branches. The gh stub is honest where it matters: `auth status` fails
   until `auth login` runs (so the walkthrough path is genuinely
   exercised), and `repo create --push` performs a REAL `git push` into a
   local bare repo — the negative grep runs over an actually-pushed
   payload, not a simulation. Opt-in asserts (hard-fail, non-vacuous):
   state `step_backup: done` + `answer_backup_optin: yes`; the numbered
   auth walkthrough shown; raw token (GOODTOKEN789, stored via the
   Telegram step in the same run) grep over the pushed repo's FULL history
   = 0; token FILENAME absent from the pushed tree; pushed tree non-empty
   (`install-state.json` present — the grep cannot pass vacuously);
   restore command printed. Opt-out asserts: choice recorded in state,
   step done, enable-later command printed, and the fake-GitHub repo count
   unchanged (nothing pushed). The pushed tree listing is committed in the
   transcript: `.gitignore`, `.gitmodules`, `.qroky/heartbeat.sh`, the
   launchd plist, `framework` (gitlink), `install-state.json`,
   `telemetry/OFF` — no token file, no log. Question-inventory check
   strengthened: point 8 must be PRESENT and the maximum point must be
   exactly 8 (7 tagged prompts across 8 points — points 3 and 4 are
   checks, not questions, as before).

### Harness status

Full re-run 10/10 PASS (`../102-kit-amendment/workspace/SUMMARY.txt`), all
prior scenarios untouched in intent — their feeds gained one trailing `n`
(backup opt-out) so v0.1.0 behavior stays pinned. Question inventory:
exactly 8 points, none beyond, zero prompts outside the interview.

### Added cost (this amendment round)

~70k tokens (install.sh + 3 locales + 3 READMEs + harness scenario +
full 10-scenario re-run + records), inside the ~150k round budget; no E4.

### Deviations (this round, none silent)

- The gh-missing and auth-failure degradation branches are code-reviewed
  but not scenario-exercised (the stub gh always exists and its login
  always succeeds) — same evidence class as the F8 launchctl note above.
- `install.log` is excluded from backups wholesale (see above) — a
  deliberate stricter-than-mandated choice, documented here and in the
  gitignore block's own comment line.
