# push.sh — Qroky pilot telemetry push (Flow Support v0)
# ============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES, IN PLAIN LANGUAGE:
#   Once a day, it looks through your Qroky repo for a small, FIXED list of
#   files that describe HOW your work went — never WHAT you built — copies
#   only the allowed content into a local "staging" folder, and (in a real
#   deployment) pushes that staging folder to a private repo the pilot team
#   controls: qroky/pilot-telemetry. You can read every line below; nothing
#   here is hidden or obfuscated.
#
# WHAT NEVER LEAVES YOUR MACHINE (the five items below and nothing else):
#     1. STATUS.md            — the atom's short progress log
#     2. RESULT.md cost block — ONLY the "cost:" section of RESULT.md's
#                                 frontmatter (tokens, time, who ran it, and
#                                 — only if you separately opted in, see
#                                 WORK-UNIT NOTE below — one short structural
#                                 work_unit tag). The Summary, Deliverables,
#                                 Decisions and Handoff sections of RESULT.md
#                                 are NEVER copied — that is where your
#                                 product would be described, so it is
#                                 excluded on purpose.
#     3. run.log               — the append-only step log inside workspace/
#     4. status.yaml           — the one-line-per-atom status board
#     5. VERDICT.md            — the independent reviewer's verdict file
#                                 ("verify verdicts")
#   Nothing else is ever read for content. Any other file — your INPUT.md,
#   your specs, your code, your decision records, a stray secrets.txt — is
#   found, logged as "SKIPPED (not on the whitelist)", and never opened.
#   This is "deny-by-default": the default answer for any file is NO.
#
# CONTENT FILTERING MODE (ATOM-079 register #3 — SETTLED at G2, GATE-019:
# CEO chose "A — content filtering". This is now the ONLY path this script
# runs. STATUS.md, run.log, status.yaml and VERDICT.md are always reduced to
# their structural fields only (no free-text notes, no Findings prose, no
# progress-log sentences) before copying — see the copy_*_filtered()
# functions below. The consent text (CONSENT.<lang>.md) promises exactly
# this and nothing else; there is no remaining code path that copies these
# four files whole ("вариант B — honest whole-file disclosure" was the
# rejected alternative offered at G2 and is not implemented here).
CONTENT_FILTER_MODE="filtered"
#
# YOUR OFF SWITCH:
#   Create an empty file named "OFF" in this same folder (next to this
#   script, i.e. telemetry/OFF) and run this script again. It will print a
#   loud message, copy and push NOTHING, and exit 0 (success — "I did
#   nothing, on purpose" is not a failure). Delete telemetry/OFF to turn
#   telemetry back on.
#   ATOM-078 register #5: turning OFF after telemetry has actually sent
#   something before is treated as a REVOCATION, not just a pause — see
#   "DELETION ON REVOCATION" below.
#
# DELETION — BY DATE AND ON REVOCATION (register #5 — SETTLED at G2,
# GATE-019: CEO chose "B — runbook"):
#   The consent document's "Ștergere"/"Удаление" field fixes a deletion
#   date in writing at signing. If that date is written into a file named
#   "DELETE-BY" next to this script (one line, YYYY-MM-DD), this script
#   checks it on every run:
#     - once today's date reaches or passes DELETE-BY, this script stops
#       sending (writes telemetry/OFF for you) and logs a deletion request;
#     - the same deletion-request logging fires the moment telemetry/OFF is
#       found AND this workspace has sent something before (a marker file,
#       telemetry/.ever-sent, records that fact — never before that).
#   Real production wiring (ATOM-071 setup kit, once push_to_remote() below
#   is no longer a stub) must forward each logged request to an actual
#   delete against qroky/pilot-telemetry. Until then, the code-side part —
#   detecting the trigger, stopping sends, and writing a dated, auditable
#   local record — is real and runs every time; the human-executed removal
#   of already-sent copies at the real remote is a weekly, dated, logged
#   runbook step (see ../../078-fix-round/workspace/telemetry-deletion-runbook.md,
#   and the "owner" section of ../../071-setup-kit/setup/QUICKSTART.<lang>.md)
#   — this is the settled, permanent mechanism per GATE-019 register #5
#   ("B — runbook"), not a stopgap awaiting further CEO confirmation.
#
# WORK-UNIT NOTE (ATOM-078 register #11, decidable after GATE-018/E8-1):
#   E8-1 answered "opt-in": a founder may separately allow one short,
#   structural work_unit tag (e.g. "1 role spec, 60 lines" — never free
#   text, never a sentence) to travel with the RESULT.md cost block, so the
#   pilot can re-anchor pricing per unit of work, not just per token. This
#   is the SAME opt-in as the TEAM-summary content line (see
#   showcase/render.sh and CONSENT.<lang>.md's separate opt-in item) — this
#   script looks for the same marker file the consent records that choice
#   in: consent/TEAM-CONTENT-OPTIN. Absent that file, no work_unit field is
#   ever read or copied, regardless of whether RESULT.md happens to carry
#   one.
#
# THIS BUILD IS A DRY RUN, ALWAYS:
#   The final "send it to qroky/pilot-telemetry" step is a stub in this
#   showcase build — see push_to_remote() near the bottom. It never makes a
#   network call and never runs `git push`. It only prints what it WOULD
#   send. A production setup (ATOM-071 setup kit) wires push_to_remote() to
#   a real, consented git remote — only after the founder has signed the
#   consent text in consent/CONSENT.<lang>.md.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./push.sh [REPO_ROOT] [STAGING_DIR]
#     REPO_ROOT    the founder's Qroky repo to scan (default: three levels
#                   up from this script — i.e. the repo this kit ships in,
#                   for the worked self-test; a founder's setup script
#                   points this at their own repo, explicitly — see
#                   ../setup/bootstrap.sh Step 6, which always passes the
#                   founder's real workspace path here, never the default)
#     STAGING_DIR   where the allowed copies are written (default: a fresh
#                   temp folder, printed at the end so you can inspect it)

# Fix-round 1: ATOM-078 (register #3, #5, #11) — 2026-07-07
# Fix-round 2: ATOM-079 (register #3=A settled as the only path, #5=B
#              language settled, per GATE-019 pivot) — 2026-07-07
# Purpose: prove the whitelist mechanics end-to-end before pilot kickoff.
# What this script changes: nothing in REPO_ROOT (it only reads there); it
# writes only inside STAGING_DIR (never your repo) and, for the deletion
# trigger and OFF switch, small marker/log files inside this telemetry/
# folder itself (DELETE-BY is read-only to this script; .ever-sent and
# deletion-requests.log are the only files this script ever writes there).
