# negative-test.sh — proves push.sh's whitelist and OFF switch actually work
# ============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES (four tests, run in order):
#
#   TEST 1 — deny-by-default AND structural filtering: builds a throwaway
#   fake repo in a sandbox under /private/tmp containing BOTH whitelisted
#   files (STATUS.md, RESULT.md, run.log, status.yaml, VERDICT.md) AND two
#   planted files that must NEVER be sent: a fake INPUT.md and a secret.txt.
#   Runs push.sh against the sandbox with its default (and, since ATOM-079,
#   only) mode — content filtering, register #3=A — then checks the staging
#   output does not contain either planted file's content anywhere.
#
#   TEST 2 — OFF switch: temporarily places telemetry/OFF next to push.sh,
#   runs push.sh again, and checks it staged and pushed nothing at all
#   (exit 0, loud message, zero files touched). The marker is removed again
#   at the end regardless of outcome, so the kit ships with telemetry ON
#   by default.
#
#   TEST 3 (register #3=A, settled at G2/GATE-019) — filtered content mode:
#   runs push.sh (filtered is the only mode there is now — no env var
#   selects a "wholefile" alternative any more) against a VERDICT.md whose
#   Findings body contains a planted business-descriptive sentence, and
#   checks that sentence is stripped from the staged copy (only frontmatter
#   survives).
#
#   TEST 4 (register #5=B, settled at G2/GATE-019) — deletion on
#   revocation: runs push.sh once for real (staging something, which writes
#   the .ever-sent marker), then plants OFF and runs again, and checks a
#   deletion request was logged to deletion-requests.log.
#
# No network calls are made anywhere in this test (push.sh's own push step
# is a stub — see push.sh's push_to_remote()). Nothing outside /private/tmp
# and this script's own directory is written to (this script also cleans up
# push.sh's own state files — .ever-sent, deletion-requests.log — that
# TEST 4 deliberately causes push.sh to write next to it).
#
# Usage: ./negative-test.sh   (no arguments; self-contained)
# Author: pilot-toolsmith (ATOM-072) · Date: 2026-07-07
# Fix-round 1: ATOM-078 (register #3, #5) — 2026-07-07
# Fix-round 2: ATOM-079 (register #3=A settled as the only mode — the
#              QROKY_TELEMETRY_FILTER_MODE env var no longer has an
#              alternative to select) — 2026-07-07
